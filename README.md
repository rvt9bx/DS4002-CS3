# DS4002-CS3 
Restaurant Price Level and Customer Satisfaction Case Study by Eleanor Byrd, DS 4002 Spring 2025

# Hook and Rubric
The hook document describing the motivation and prompt for this project can be found at [Hook.pdf](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/Hook.pdf). Further explanation of the requirements for completion of this case study can be found in [Rubric.pdf](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/Rubric.pdf).

# Data
The data was originally downloaded from [Yelp Open data](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/). It was cleaned to contain only restaurants in Philadelphia and the corresponding reviews. This can be found in the DATA folder in [philly_restaurants.csv](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/DATA/philly_restaurants.csv) and [philly_reviews.csv](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/DATA/philly_reviews.csv). Additional information about the datasets can be found in the [data appendix](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/DATA/data_appendix.pdf). 

# Code 
Some helpful code to perform the analysis required in this case study can be found in the SCRIPTS folder [analysis_source_code.ipynb](https://github.com/rvt9bx/DS4002-CS3/blob/main/SCRIPTS/analysis_source_code.ipynb). It requires Python 3.1x as well as the packages pandas, nltk, scipy, and seaborn. 

# Materials 
The MATERIALS folder contains some helpful resources to complete this case study. I highly recommend learning more about VADER sentiment analysis as well as different correlational analysis techniques before performing the analysis.
